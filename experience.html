<p class="w3-center"><em>My journey to Perlis in October is a memorable and beloved memory, one that stands out in my life for the joy, connections, and sense of discovery it provided. 
    The journey began with a purpose: to accompany my sister back to her institution, UniMAP. Little did I realize that this would be my first visit to the tranquil state of Perlis, 
    and that I would depart with a heart full of contentment and a great appreciation for its calm appeal.Perlis, which is typically disregarded in favor of Malaysia's more crowded states, impressed me with its calm pace and gorgeous simplicity. 
    As I made my way there, I had no idea what to anticipate, but the moments that followed would provide me with a new perspective on the tranquil beauty of northern Malaysia. When we initially came, I observed how different the pace of life was. 
    The town had a relaxing atmosphere, the air was fresh, and the surroundings were green and peaceful. There was a sense of tranquility that seemed to pervade the entire area, setting the tone for a memorable journey.Our first stop after settling in was Timah Tasoh, which appeared to capture the beauty of Perlis in a few simple strokes. Timah Tasoh Lake is a beautiful place surrounded by thick foliage, perfect for outdoor activities. I spent a lovely time with my family here, amid the peace and quiet of nature. My eyes were pulled to the vast expanses from the time we arrived, which were ideal for a family outing. My family and I opted to rent bicycles and scooter motors, which proved to be an exciting experience.As the day progressed, our plans led us to another highlight of the trip: dining at Sabut Kelapa Bakar, a well-known local café near our homestay. The warmth of the evening heightened the excitement of the meal, as the prospect of eating fresh, delectable ikan bakar (grilled fish) made my stomach growl with anticipation. The café was a short walk from our accommodation, making it a quick and pleasant dining option. I could tell that the cuisine here would not only be delicious, but also an important part of the Perlis experience.
    <br></em></p><br>
    <p class="w3-center"><em> As the day came to an end, I found myself wishing the vacation had lasted longer. I wished I could have stayed longer, explored more, and really immersed myself in Perlis' quiet appeal. There was still so much to uncover, from the state's natural beauty to the hidden gems of local cuisine and cultural activities. I didn't want the tranquility of the lake, the excitement of the bike ride, or the warmth of the dinner to end. But as the sun went down and the stars began to glitter above, I realized that sometimes the beauty of an experience lay in its brevity.Reflecting on my experience in Perlis, I felt incredibly grateful for the opportunity to visit this beautiful state. It wasn't just about visiting new places or trying new things; it was about the bonds I formed with my family, the memories we made, and the small moments of bliss that made it all worthwhile. Perlis, with its serene vistas and genuine friendliness, had made an everlasting impression on my heart.As I drove home, I held out hope that one day I'd be able to return, perhaps with my entire family. The desire to revisit those peaceful moments, to ride bikes by the lake, and to have a dinner at Sabut Kelapa Bakar persisted. Perlis had a gentle magic to it that I was only beginning to discover. There was so much more to discover, and I knew that when the time came, I'd come to this serene corner of Malaysia to revel in the peacefulness and delight of being with my loved ones.<br></em></p><br>
